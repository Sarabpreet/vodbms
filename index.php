			<h3>Why Database?</h3>

		<p>Over the years of information technology history, it’s been seen that the data has been bigger, as compared to what it was when the era started. Database is an important part of it. it can manage that large amount of data that would become unmanageable in a spreadsheet form, database management system also allows to record the data in real time as per the user's wish, it retrieves the data which would be used by any data-driven application, database management system can also be used to change the particular data in a table, it is also used to generates reports and gives a statistical analysis of the entire system</p>

			<h3>About  VODBMS</h3>

		<p>Data-Driven applications are important for most of the app’s logic. If it’s a social media website or a simple calorie counter it will require a database system to showcase the data.  but these data-driven applications are only limited with people who can type, click, or write a proper code, but with the help of this system, people who cannot type or people who are visually impaired can also use this VODBMS to enter data.it can also be used by users who are willing to have an alternative way of typing.
